Black box integration routines for C++


I often run into the need of wanting an integration routine
which simply gives me an answer, no messing around with
quadrature parameters. While the latter is more useful
in numerical analysis because the numerical properties of
a method can then be analyzed as functions of integration
parameters, sometimes I just want a number and a reasonable
confidence level of its correctness.
